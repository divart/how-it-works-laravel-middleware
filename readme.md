## Instructor: [Matthew Machuga][instructor url]


There are lots of times we need to run a bit of code before or after a request is made to a web server. For example, we might need to authenticate a certain route, we might wnat to log requests, etc. That's where Laravel Middleware comes in! 

In this Coffee Break Course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Matthew Machuga will show you how middleware works, how it flows through an application, and how to  create middleware of your own.


## Source Files Description

This repository contains a simple code example that demonstrates how middleware works. To run the example code that demonstrates how the middleware works, run:

Play around with this script to see how various changes might affect how the
middleware executes.
